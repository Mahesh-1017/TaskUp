---

## 1. The Introduction (The "Why")

*   **Hook:** Start by talking about the importance of communication. "In today's world, we all need simple, secure, and engaging ways to connect with friends and family. But many apps are bloated or complicated."
*   **Introduce Your Solution:** "Today, I'm presenting **NumeroConnect**, a web-based chat application designed to solve this problem. It offers a clean, modern, and intuitive user experience."
*   **Mention the Technology:** "I built NumeroConnect using a modern tech stack: **Next.js** for the frontend, **React** for building interactive components, and **Firebase** for secure user authentication."

## 2. The Live Demonstration (The "How-To")

Follow this flow to tell a compelling story.

**Step 1: Secure Onboarding**
*   **Action:** Start at the "Sign Up" page. Enter a phone number.
*   **Talking Point:** "First, let's create an account. Security is a top priority, so NumeroConnect uses Firebase Phone Authentication for password-less login. This sends a one-time password directly to your phone, which is more secure than traditional passwords."
*   **Action:** Go to the OTP screen. Show the options to "Resend OTP" or "Change Number". Enter the fake OTP.
*   **Talking Point:** "The app provides a robust OTP verification screen. If you made a mistake or didn't get the code, you have options to try again."

**Step 2: The Main Chat Interface**
*   **Action:** After "logging in," you'll land on the main chat screen.
*   **Talking Point:** "Once logged in, the user is greeted with a clean, two-panel layout. On the left, we have the contact list, and the main area is for conversations. This is built with a responsive design that works on both desktop and mobile."

**Step 3: Personalization**
*   **Action:** Click on your profile at the bottom-left and navigate to the "Your Profile" page. Change the name and upload a new profile picture.
*   **Talking Point:** "Users can personalize their experience. On the profile page, you can update your display name and set a custom avatar. This data can be saved, providing a persistent identity within the app."

**Step 4: Interactive Chat**
*   **Action:** Go back to a chat and select a contact. Type a new message and hit send.
*   **Talking Point:** "The core of the app is the chat itself. As you can see, I can type a message, and it instantly appears in the conversation history with the correct styling for an outgoing message. This provides immediate, real-time feedback to the user."

**Step 5: Sharing & Inviting**
*   **Action:** Click the "Share" icon in the sidebar.
*   **Talking Point:** "To help the app grow, I've included a simple way for users to invite their friends to join NumeroConnect by sharing a link to the app."

**Step 6: Voice & Video Calls (The "Wow" Factor)**
*   **Action:** Click the video camera icon in a chat header.
*   **Talking Point:** "Now for the most exciting feature: real-time communication. With a single click, a user can start a video call. The app requests camera and microphone access, which is crucial for WebRTC functionality."
*   **Action:** Your browser will ask for permission. Grant it. Your local video feed will appear.
*   **Talking Point:** "As you can see, the app now has access to my camera, and I can see my own video feed. This screen shows what a live call would look like. I've built all the UI controls for muting the mic, turning off video, and ending the call. While the actual connection to another user requires a complex backend signaling server, I've built the complete frontend foundation to make it happen."

## 3. The Conclusion (The "What's Next")

*   **Summarize:** "So, in this demo, I've shown a complete, user-centric chat application with secure authentication, a dynamic chat interface, user profiles, and a fully prepared UI for voice and video calling."
*   **Future Plans:** "For the next steps, I would integrate a backend service like Firebase Firestore for real-time messaging and build out the WebRTC signaling server to enable the live calls between users."
*   **Q&A:** "Thank you for your time. I'm now open for any questions."
